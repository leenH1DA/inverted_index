# inverted_index
The Inverted Index is the data structure used to support full text search over a set of documents.
It is constituted by a big table where there is one entry per word in all the documents processed,
along with a list of the key pairs: document id, frequency of the term in the document.

# How does it work?

- Collect the documents to be indexed â€“ I will use simple strings for while;
- Tokenize the text, turning each document into a list of tokens
- Do linguistic preprocessing, producing a list of indexing terms
- Index the documents that each term occurs in by creating an inverted index, consisting of a dictionary and postings.
